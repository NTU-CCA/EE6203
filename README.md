# EE6203 - Computer Control Systems

### Learning Objective:

Practically all control systems that are implemented today are based on computer control. It is therefore important to understand computer-controlled systems well. The purpose of the subject is to provide a thorough background for understanding, analyzing and designing of computer-controlled systems. The objectives include equipping students with the control theory that is relevant to the analysis and design of computer-controlled systems. Topics such as time-domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, state space analysis will be covered. The design and implementation issues of computer-controlled systems will also be extensively discussed with real world case study.

### Content:

Discrete-time system modelling and analysis. Cascade compensation. State-space design methods.
Optimal control. Design and implementation of digital controllers.

### Learning Outcome:

On completion of the subject, the students should be able to understand specific theories of computercontrolled systems, carry out the design of controllers to meet desired performance specifications through various design techniques such as the frequency and state space approaches, understand practical implementation techniques and considerations from a software and hardware point of view.
